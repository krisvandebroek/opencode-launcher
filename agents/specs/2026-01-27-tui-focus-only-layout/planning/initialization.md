# Initialization

## Raw Idea
Review the UX, keeping in mind the @agents/product/mission.md.

The first screenshot is a failed UX when the screen size is limited.
In this case it's probably better that the non-active columns only contain the title, reducing the width and allowing it to be on a small screen.
Tab will then make the next column visible and hide previous.
